# Lucas Sam — Data Analyst

I'm a data analyst who enjoys turning raw data into clear, actionable insights. I work across the full pipeline — from cleaning and exploring datasets to building dashboards and web tools that make the results accessible to others.

This is my portfolio, where I share a few of the projects I've been working on.

## Projects

### JD-Match
A resume optimization tool powered by Google's Gemini AI. You paste in a job description, upload your resume, and it tells you exactly where the gaps are — no guesswork. It scores your alignment across skills, achievements, and ATS compatibility, flags missing keywords, and generates rewritten bullet points you can apply with one click.

Built with React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and the Gemini API.

### Singapore Parliamentary Elections 1955–2025
A multi-dashboard Tableau story examining the gap between votes and seats across 70 years of Singapore general elections. Explores how PAP's 65.6% vote share translates to 90.6% of parliamentary seats, and tracks the opposition's decades-long rise.

Built with Tableau.

### Gender Pay Gap Analysis
An interactive dashboard exploring the UK Gender Pay Gap using publicly available government data. It visualises trends over time, breaks down disparities by sector and region, and lets users filter the data to surface patterns that matter to them.

Built with Python, Plotly, and Pandas.
