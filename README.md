# Lucas Sam — Data Analyst

This is my personal portfolio, where I share the projects I've been working on. I like building things that are practical and solve real problems — whether that's helping someone land a job or making sense of messy data.

Take a look around: **[lucas-sam93.github.io](https://lucas-sam93.github.io)**

## What's here

### JD-Match
A resume optimization tool powered by Google's Gemini AI. You paste in a job description, upload your resume, and it tells you exactly where the gaps are — no guesswork. It scores your match, flags missing keywords, and even rewrites bullet points to be stronger.

Built with React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and the Gemini API.

### Gender Pay Gap Analysis
An interactive dashboard that explores the UK Gender Pay Gap using public data. It breaks things down by sector, region, and trends over time — all through filterable, dynamic charts.

Built with Python, Plotly, and Pandas.

## About this site

The portfolio itself is a single-page static site using Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no build step — just HTML that deploys straight to GitHub Pages.
